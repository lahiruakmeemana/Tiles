floor area = floor height * floor width

One tile area = tile height * tile width

tile require for floor =  floor area 
                          ______________
                         One tile area  


assume skirting height = X 

assume Door width is      = Y 

skirting length = {[(2(floor height)) + (2(floor width))] - Y  }

tile require for skirting = skirting length
                             ______________

                               tile width


skirting quantity can cut from one tile = One tile area

total tile require for skirting = tile require for skirting 
                                   ______________

                                     skirting quantity can cut from one tile 



full Tile amount we need for floor = total tile require for skirting + tile require for floor


add 5% of wastage =      full Tile amount we need for floor *         5
